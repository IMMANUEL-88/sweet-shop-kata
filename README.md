# üç≠ Sweetify - Sweet Shop Management System

Welcome to Sweetify, a full-stack TDD (Test-Driven Development) kata. This project is a complete Sweet Shop Management System, featuring a secure Node.js backend API and a modern, responsive React frontend.

The entire backend was built using a strict Red-Green-Refactor TDD workflow.

## Setup & Installation

To run this project locally, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your system and create a free MongoDB Atlas account and cluster in [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com) and get your connection string (URI) from the Atlas dashboard.

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/IMMANUEL-88/sweet-shop-kata
cd sweet-shop-kata/backend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create your .env file
# Create a file named .env in the /backend folder and add the following:
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string/sweet-shop-dev

# 4. Run the backend server
npm run dev
```
The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# 1. In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder
cd sweet-shop-kata/frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run the frontend development server
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be live at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port) and will be proxied to your backend.

## My AI Usage

This project was built in collaboration with an AI assistant (Google's Gemini) as a pair-programming partner.

* **Tools Used:** Google Gemini

* **How I Used It:**
    * **Backend TDD:** I used the AI to generate the "Red" (failing test) for each new endpoint based on the requirements. I would then collaborate with AI to write the "Green" (passing) code myself, and afterward, I would ask the AI to "Refactor" my code or suggest improvements (like using `asyncHandler` or atomic operations).
    * **Frontend Development:** I asked the AI to generate entire React components (like `Navbar`, `SweetCard`, and `CartSlider`) based on my feature descriptions and preferred tech (Tailwind CSS).
    * **Debugging (Most Critical):** I frequently pasted error messages (from both Jest and the browser console) directly to the AI. It helped me diagnose the root cause of complex bugs, including:
        * JavaScript typos (`e.targe` vs. `e.target.value`).
        * React infinite loops (`useCallback` dependencies).
        * CSS `z-index` stacking context problems.
        * Jest test pollution between parallel test files.
    * **Git Commits:** I asked the AI to generate descriptive, conventional commit messages for each TDD step.

* **My Reflection:** Using an AI as a pair programmer was incredibly effective. It allowed me to focus on the *architecture* and *logic* while it handled the boilerplate for tests and UI components. The debugging process was the most valuable; instead of being stuck for hours on a cryptic error, I could get an immediate diagnosis and solution, which taught me *why* the bug was happening. It made the entire TDD process faster and more educational.
